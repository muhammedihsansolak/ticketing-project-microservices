### Business Logics

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><B>Soft Delete Implementation:</B>
<ul>The system uses a soft delete approach. This ensures that records are not permanently deleted. It protects historical data and maintains data integrity.</ul>
</li>

<li><B>Unique Constraints:</B>
<ul>Made usernames and project codes unique in the system. This prevents duplication and ensures reliable identification.</ul>
</li>

<li><B>Manager Deletion Restriction:</B>
<ul>Managers cannot be deleted if they are assigned to a project. This precaution prevents data loss by keeping managerial associations with ongoing projects.</ul>
</li>

<li><B>Employee Deletion Restriction:</B>
<ul>Cannot delete employees with assigned tasks. This is to keep task data and avoid losing information by mistake.</ul>
</li>

<li><B>Manager Project Completion Authorization:</B>
<ul>Managers can mark a project as completed only if all tasks for the project are also marked as completed. This ensures that projects are considered complete only when all related tasks are successfully finished, keeping a full view of project status.</ul>
</li>

<li><B>Admin Project Completion Authorization:</B>
<ul>When an admin user marks a project as completed, all tasks associated with that project are also marked as completed. This keeps everything consistent and shows how projects and tasks are connected.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
